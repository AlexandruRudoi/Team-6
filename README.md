# Team 6 - OCR Handwriting Recognition

## Description
This project, developed during [XMAS FAF HACKATHON], aims to develop a robust OCR model that accurately recognizes characters from handwritten schedules, ensuring a seamless transition from paper tables to digital tables. This technology should enhance the overall schedule management process, making it more reliable and accessible.

## Solution
We used Google API OCR which was trained on handwritten photos and can generate digital text. It was implemented in our app and was modified so that it recognizes handwritten tables and converts them to plain text.


## The Roadmap
- Implementation of the OCR model
- We discovered that we can easier our lives by using Google API (vision)
- Output formation
